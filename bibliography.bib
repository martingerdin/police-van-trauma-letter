abstract = {Background: In resource-limited settings, prehospital trauma care and transportation from the scene to a hospital is not well developed. Critically injured patients present to the hospital via privately owned vehicles (PV), public transportation, or the police. We aimed to determine the mortality following road traffic injury based on the mode of transportation to our trauma center. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) Trauma Registry from January 2011 to May 2018. Patients with road traffic injuries, presenting from the scene, were included. Those brought in dead or discharged from casualty were excluded. Bivariate analysis was performed over mortality. A Poisson multivariate regression determined the relative risk of mortality by prehospital transportation. Results: 2853 patients were included; 7.8{\%} (n = 223) died. Patients were transported by PV (n = 1963, 68.8{\%}), minibus (n = 497, 17.4{\%}), and police (268, 9.4{\%}). No patients were transported by ambulance. Patients transported by police (1 h, IQR 0–2) and PV (1 h, IQR 0–2), arrived earlier than those transported by minibus (2 h, IQR 0–27), p {\textless} 0.001. There was no difference in injury severity between the transportation cohorts. Compared to PV, patients transported by police (RR 1.56, 95{\%} CI 1.13–2.17, p = 0.008) have an increased risk of mortality after controlling for injury severity. There was no difference in mortality in patients presenting by minibus (RR 0.83, 95{\%} CI 0.55–1.24, p = 0.4). Conclusion: Patients transported to KCH via police have a higher risk of mortality than those transported via private vehicle after controlling for injury severity. Training police in basic life support may be an initial target of intervention in reducing trauma mortality. Overall, the creation of a functional prehospital ambulance system with a cadre of paramedics is necessary for both trauma and non-trauma patients alike. This can only be achieved by training all stakeholders, the police, public transport drivers, and the public at large.},

@article{Abbafati2020,
abstract = {Background: In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries. Methods: GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution. Findings: Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990-2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0-9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10-24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10-24 years were also in the top ten in the 25-49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50-74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI. Interpretation: As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Survival after major trauma is considered to be time dependent.  Efficient prehospital care with rapid transport is the norm in developed countries, which is not available in many lower middle and low-income countries. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of prehospital time and primary treatment given on survival of major trauma patients in a setting without prehospital care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was carried out in a university hospital in Mumbai, from January to December 2014. The hospital has a trauma service but no organized prehospital care or defined interhospital transfer protocols. All patients with life- and/or limb-threatening injuries were included in the study. Injury time and arrival time were noted and the interval was defined as "prehospital time" for the directly arriving patients and as "time to tertiary care" for those transferred. Primary outcome measure was in-hospital death (or discharge). RESULTS: Of 1181 patients, 352 were admitted directly from the trauma scene and 829 were transferred from other hospitals. In-hospital mortality was associated with age, mechanism and mode of injury, shock, Glasgow Coma Score {\textless}9, Injury Severity Score ???16, need for intubation, and ventilatory support on arrival; but neither with prehospital time nor with time to tertiary care. Transferred patients had a significantly higher mortality (odds ratio = 1.869, 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.233-2.561, P = 0.005) despite fewer patients with severe injury. Two hundred and ninety-four (35{\%}) of these needed airway intervention while 108 (13{\%}) needed chest tube insertion on arrival to the trauma unit suggesting inadequate care at primary facility. CONCLUSION: Mortality is not associated with prehospital time but with transfers from primary care; probably due to deficient care. To improve survival after major trauma, enhancement of resources for resuscitation and capacity building of on-duty doctors in primary centers should be a priority in countries with limited resources.},
